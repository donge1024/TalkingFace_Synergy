# TalkingFace_Synergy
This papper proposes a Talking Face method that combines visual content with driving audio for spatial-temporal modeling to enhance the synergy between different modalities. Our method includes two core strategies: Temporal Similarity Alignment (TSA) and Spatial Topological Fusion (STF). Through joint modeling, temporal similarity alignment can measure the similarity between audio and head motion to obtain a coherent head movement sequence; spatial topological fusion generates realistic facial movement changes by establishing the topological structure of audio and facial motion. Extensive experimental results show that this method effectively alleviates the problem of insufficient synergy in talking person videos and performs significantly better than existing methods.
